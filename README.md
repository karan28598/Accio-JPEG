# Accio-JPEG
Tool to recover deleted JPEGs from memory. Works like a "charm".

# Description
I spent the past several days taking photos of people I know, all of which were saved by my digital camera as JPEGs on a memory card. (Okay, it’s possible I actually spent the past several days on Facebook instead.) Unfortunately, I somehow deleted them all! Thankfully, in the computer world, "deleted" tends not to mean "deleted" so much as "forgotten." My computer insists that the card is now blank, but I’m pretty sure that’s not quite true. Indeed, I wrote a program that recovers the photos for me!
